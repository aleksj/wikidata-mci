## üìñ Overview

**[WikiData](wikidata.org)** is a vast knowledge base with over 100 million entities, making it an incredible resource for  exploration and querying.

**WikiData-MCI** is a new-generation AI-enhanced interface to Wikidata that offers the power of large language models, agentic technology based on MCP, and user-friendly visual interactivity.

**Model-Context-Interface** is the user interface developed for access to a MCP server. It performs a similar role as a web browser would in interfacing with a HTTP server.

Namely, MCP servers aren't just for agents, they're also for humans. MCIs are designed to augment human intelligence and provide a user-friendly interface for accessing MCP servers. Both agents and interfaces employ LLM technology.

## üåü Features

- **MCP**: Model-Context-Protocol interfaces orchestrates the connection between LLM and WikiData.
- **LLM**: Large Language Models for enhanced querying and exploration capabilities, for example enabling automatic conversion of natural language queries into SPARQL queries and summarization of the results.
- **Visualization**: The structures returned by WikiData are rendered as interactive knowledge graphs, allowing additional information to be expanded into, and providing a visual representation of the relationships between entities.
- **Interactivity**: Providing a real-time feedback loop giving insight into the working of the agentic knowledge exploration process.
